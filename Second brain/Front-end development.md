The **front-end development** is the area of the [[Web development]] which deals with the user-side, it means that the front-end is on charge to develop all the code which the client will receive and his browser will read and run. 

## Fundamentals
To develop in the front-end development we must to learn some languages, unlike the [[Back-end development]] or other [[Programming]] areas, we can't choose, rather there is a set of languages standardized through all the browsers which we have to learn to develop in **front-end development**. Those are: 

+ [[HTML]] | For the content structure
+ [[CSS]] | For the styling
+ [[JavaScript]] | For the dynamist (Is the unique programming language in the list)

And then we can choose different libraries and even preprocessors to make the process faster and nicer.
