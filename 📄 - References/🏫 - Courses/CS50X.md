# What will I learn?

A introduction to [[Computer Science]], where we'll learn to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently, also well learn concepts such as [[Abstraction]],  [[Algorithms]], [[Data structures]], [[Encapsulation]], [[Resource management]], [[Security]], software engineering and [[Web development]]. Also we'll learn about some [[Programming languages]] such as [[C]], [[Python]], [[SQL]] and  [[JavaScript]], plus [[CSS]] and [[HTML]]. 

```ad-quote
 What ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to yourself when you began.
