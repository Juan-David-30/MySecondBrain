# What will I learn?

To develop a valuable mathematical thinking, useful to solve problems of a mathematical way and also have a better transition from high school mathematics to university mathematics.

In this course we won't learn mathematical procedures but mathematical thinking, and acquire the logic to think in a mathematical way.

### Lecture 0
+ What is the [[Mathematical thinking]].
Learning [[Mathematical thinking]] won't be easy, we have to change both our thinking and mind-set, from applying templates or formulas to understanding the problem, it might sound easy, but sometimes it may become hard and frustrating. Is important to stay strong and understand that as all the skills is a process where the practice is determinant, you might also motivate yourself through thinking that once you develop a mathematical thinking all the maths will become "easier". 
```ad-quote
Your goal has to be understanding, not doing.

+ [[BackgroundRead_Lect0 _MathThinking_StandfordOnline.pdf|Back ground reading]] - What is [[Mathematics]]? - notes:
	 1. [[What is mathematics?]]
	 2. [[Mathematical notation]]
	 3. Modern college-level mathematics:
		In the actuality in the college we start to take an approach to mathematics more oriented to understand rather to do, yet, this is a approach that isn't implemented in the high schools and even in many colleges around the world. As we've said all these exponential growth or evolution of the mathematics is really recent.
		
		The mathematics was recently redefined as the science of patterns, which goes beyond the numbers, however it still being regarded primarily as **calculation**. And in the most of the high schools still taking that approach.
	4. [[Mathematics moving off from reality and numbers]]
	5.  Why to learn that stuff?
		The mathematical thinking of a modern way is important and indispensable in case that you want to create new mathematics, physics or do any sort of research or innovation in any technical or mathematical-related area.
		
		But beside this objetives it still being useful in many other jobs, if you domain a mathematical thinking and understanding, you will have a better skill using the other mathematic procedures. Also in the actuality we're living a revolution where business need people able not just to solve mathematical problems, but also find them and set them, think that you can do if you understand the mathematical thinking.
