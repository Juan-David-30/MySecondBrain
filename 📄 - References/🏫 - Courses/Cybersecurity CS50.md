# What will I learn?

We'll learn how to write some code in [[python]] and learn about different topics of cyber security such as passwords and how to keep them save. 

"Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminals use and practice of ensuring confidentially and integrity, and availability of information"

# Introduction class

+ What is cybersecurity about?
+ Hackers
	Hackers are the adversaries or people who try to attack us or brake our security for whatever reason
+ Trade off
	We could create a complete secure device, but if we get it it would probably lose usability, so the cybersecurity can be thought as a trade off of security and usability.
	
	So our goal is to make our security enough secure to make the adversary work harder and so that discourage them. 
+ We're in disadvantage
	Is necessary to understand that that we're in constant disadvantage, we can have security tools, but if we forget to use them, then we'll lost, whilst the hacker or adversary just needs to find one unique mistake they've won, we have to be perfect, while the adversary just needs to find one mistake. 

## Authentication

Authentication is a process where we determinate whether you are who you say you are, in internet you determinate whether or not you are the owner of you account, because isn't enough with just typing you're username, commonly you also have to validate that you're the owner of the account in other ways, such as using a passwords (the most common), double factor-authentication and so on. 

So this second way to authenticate your self is actually really important to make it secure. 

### Password

Is really important to have a secure password, and that's not often well supplied by the users, indeed the most popular password world wide, are sequences of numbers such as 1234, or alike, which of course isn't secure, someone could try this because it is such simple and popular that can make you be hacked easily. 

Other common error is to use the same password for your accounts, which exposes us to the threat that if some one figures out our password in one account in whatever way, then they can try that same password on the another accounts and then we have a worse case. 

Other problem is to use short passwords, because there can be people who knows how to program and they could just use a program which tries all the possibilities and then hack us quickly. So is important to make our passwords of a considerable long and not just that but mix them with several options such as letters, numbers and special characters, the explication is simple and that just [[mathematics]], specifically that's a permutations where we find all the possibilities and we run through them.
