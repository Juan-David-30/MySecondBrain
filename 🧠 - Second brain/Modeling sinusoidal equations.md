To model [[Sinusoidal equations]] equations we must have an understanding of the behavior of its graph or in general function, and then realize of some techniques or ways to transform that function so it represents properly our specific case


# Amplitude 

One of the first thing which we must notices is the amplitude of the function, which is the maximum distance from the equilibrium spot of the graph respect to its highest and lowest point. To set the amplitude we have to multiply the [[Trigonometric functions|trigonometric function]] by the amplitude: 

$$A\sin\theta $$
Above A represents the amplitude, if you want to find the amplitude because you're not sure which is the correct for your specific case, what you could do is:
$$A = \frac{highestBound - LowestBound}{2}$$

# Equilibrium spot

Now we also have to set the equilibrium spot or in other words the spot or place which is the half of the range of the function, the point in which will start (in the sine case) or simply the displacement in the y axis of its roots respect of the x axis
$$\sin\theta+E$$

Above E represents the equilibrium spot, and again if you're not sure of which could be the one for your case, you can rely on the highest and lowest bound of your specific case as follows:
$$E = \frac{highestBound + LowestBound}{2}$$

# Period 

As we've seen multiple times the [[Trigonometric functions]] are periodic, so it means that they repeat over and over its outputs as we advance for the x values, we can also modify this period so we can set a different range of values for that period, the concept is pretty easy, we know that $2\pi$ is a period commonly for a common trigonometric function, because that's a whole revolution through the [[Unit circle]], know let's use that concept and divide it by the new number of units which represent a whole revolution.
$$\sin(\frac{2\pi}{Rev}\cdot x)$$

x represents what value of the new quantity of revolutions we've advanced.


# Conclusion

The modeling of sinusoidal equations is pretty important and useful, in the area of mathematics has multiple applications, but they're not confined to them, they also can be useful for [[Generative art]] mainly for they're property of periodicity, and also in [[Physics]], even some Harmonic movements are modeled and explained with sinusoidal functions and equations.
