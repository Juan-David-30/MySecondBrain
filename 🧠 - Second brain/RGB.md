RGB is the way how colors are represented just by setting an amount of red, green and blue, by mixing different amounts of them we can get a lot of colors which we see represented in our screen.

Indeed our screens work in this manner, our screens arenâ€™t more but a bunch of pixels which at the same time are groups of three lights one red, one green and one blue:

So images are just a extensive bunch of RGB values arranged in a bi-dimensional space. Indeed a video are a sequence of images changing over the time plus a audio running at the same time.
