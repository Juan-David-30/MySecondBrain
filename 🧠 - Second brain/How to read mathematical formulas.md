Learn how to read mathematical formulas is something really important when we're learning pure mathematics, and of course when we're learning [[Mathematical logic|formal logic]] we're learning how to write this proofs and formulas somehow, but its necessary to set some rules of the elements which we've already seen. 

# Quantifiers

The [[quantifiers]] are read or apply for the state next to it: 

$(\forall L)(\ldots)$ 

In this case the quantifier "for all" will apply for the statement next to it, we can use the parentheses to make it more clear, but often they're not required so we can find the quantifier without parentheses and the statement neither(If the statement is short, otherwise probably well see the statement surrounded by parentheses or square brackets). Is also important to understand that L is bound to the next statement.

# Negation

The negations has the same behaviour as the quantifiers in the way that they both are confined to the next statement, and just that one statement, so we have to be aware of when we use parentheses and when not.

## Other ones

Once we've understood the quantifiers and negations we have to look at the conjunctions, and finally to the disjunctions and conditionals in that order.
