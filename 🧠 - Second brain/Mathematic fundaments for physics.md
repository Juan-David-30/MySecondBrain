# What will I learn?

We'll learn basic necessary concepts to study physics, such as the numbers, its properties operations, equations, matrices, functions, some geometry concepts and some basics in probability and statistics. 

# First module - arithmetic and algebra

## Basic operations

We have to of course be comfortable with the [[Binary operations]], with things such as the additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, potentiation, roots, and so on. 

Of course we also must know the operations order of operations, and the groupers such as the parentheses, square brackets, keys and so on. 

Of course we must be able to manage scientific notation to represent certain quantities, if they're too big or too small. 

## Real, complex and imaginary numbers

We've needed the [[Numbers]] since thousands of years ago, and they've evolved and thanks to that we've developed a bunch of different classifications and a bunch of different [[Numbers]] for different purposes. 

## Equations

We must know how to use [[Algebra]] to solve problems algebraically, what we do to solve them is by clearing equations.
