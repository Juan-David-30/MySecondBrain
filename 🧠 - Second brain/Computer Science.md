# What is Computer science?

Computer science can be often confused with [[Programming]], but really the programming is just a tool or branch of the computer science, the computer science indeed is a sub-branch of [[Mathematics]], and it study and implementation (often with the goal to solve and automatize problems or necessities) of [[Computation|computational]] patterns.

And then **Computational thinking**, is the use of computer science ideas and patterns to solve problems of your interest in any area. Commonly in conjunction of other applied mathematic science such as electronics.

# What does computer science consist in?

As said computer science consists in those computational patterns, but when we work with those computational patterns we also have to deal with information and [[How to represent information |how to represent it]] , because our computing process commonly work on it, you get a input, you do the computational process and then you return a output.

The image above is just an [[Abstraction]] of the process, where we just give a abstract representation such as a "Black box". What is actually inside this black box is [[Algorithms]].
