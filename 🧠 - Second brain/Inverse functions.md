# What's an inverse function? 

A inverse function is a function that receives the output of another function an returns its input, literally does the opposite process, receiving, that's why they're called inverse functions.

They're represented with the function to the power of -1, but remember, we're actually not referring to the inverse of that function, but its inverse function.

# How do we know when a function can be inverted

A function can be inverted when each element of the range belongs to one and only one element of the domain, otherwise if any element of the range belongs to more than one of the domain, we wouldn't be able to do the inverse mapping.

Indeed inverting a function consists in converting the range in the domain and the domain in the range. So if a element of the domain has more than one single element in the range, then it wouldn't be a function, but just a relationship. 

In the case that a function can't be inverted we say that the function is **non-invertible**, otherwise it is **invertible**.

# How do we inverse a function? 

Is a simple concept, just do the opposite process, or opposite rule which mapes the range back to the domain, algebraically we could represent by instead of clear x, we'll clear y, once we've clear y, we've got the inverse function of the initial one (there is some exception or they're limited, like the inverse of a quadratic function).
