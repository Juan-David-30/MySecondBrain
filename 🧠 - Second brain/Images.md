Retaking the idea of [[How to represent information]], we may wonder how we represent images to then show them up in the screen in [[computer science]]. 

The images are represented as a "[[Matrices|Matrix]]" or table of columns and row in which each dot, or cell, represents a pixel, it means that it represents a color. And that's it the images are a [[Matrices|Matrix]] which represents which color goes in which cell or pixel in the screen. And we just store the value which represents each cell in a specific format, commonly [[RGB]].
