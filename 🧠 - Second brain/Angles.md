In [[Euclidean geometry]], an angle is a figure formed by two rays or segments, called the sides of the angle, which are sharing a same endpoint, which is called the vertex. 

The measure of a angle is called angular measure often just angle. The angle of rotation is a measure defined as the ratio of a circular arc length to its radius. 

# Measure units

## Radians (rad)

A radian is one of the more often used units to measure angle of rotation, a radian is defined such as the angle at the centre of a circle by an arc that is equal to the length of the radius.

Commonly we work with $\pi$ units thanks that it is the relationship between the radius and the semi-circle (being for example $\frac{\pi}{2}$ a right angle). 

## Degrees($\degree$) 

The degrees are another way to measure angles, and that's defined as a plane angle in which one full rotation is 360 degrees, so is the same to splitting the circle's arc in 360 equal parts.

# Type of angles

Depending on the measure of the angle we can classify them in the following groups:

# Complementary and supplementary 

Often we'll have to deal with complementary and supplementary angles, which are the angles that complete another one to get a angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in complementary case or $\pi$ in supplementary case (90$\degree$ and 180$\degree$) respectively:
