# Ways to represent information

The information is a piece knowledge or detail about something, and that piece of knowledge can be of many sorts and have many representations. 

```ad-example

The color ðŸ”´, can be represented in language just by the word "Red"

```

And that's just one example, that same color be represented or refereed through a numerical value in many systems, such as [[Unary]], decimal, or more often use [[Binary]]. 

# How can we represent multiple types of data?

Now how could we represent multiple types of data with a same system?, for example if we in the computers already use [[Binary]] to represent numbers, how can we use them to represent for example, letters?.

That same problem was faced for some people a certain time ago, so they invented ASCII that is a sort of dictionary which maps a numeric value to a certain letter, symbol, action, number, indeed every possible key in your keyboard.

We map numbers to numbers, but our computers are able to interpret a value according to the context, and then either use of one way or or other. 

Other ways to represent information:
+ Unicode - More characters.
	Unicode is the current "Dictionary" which maps binary values to letters, actions, symbols, numbers and even emojis in our computers. Just like ASCII, but with a more wide variety of possible characters, so long that there are some values that doesn't fit in just one byte, so use multiple bytes. 
	
	There are some emojis which are really similar between them, but with some little variations, such as the color, for example there are some persons which just vary in their skin color, it would be really expensive to map a value to each one, rather we can divide the values, and then we have one byte which defines de structure and other which defines the color. 
	
	And some emojis are compound of many figures, so we can define a byte to map each figure, so we can mix them creating many combinatorics which come from the same bytes, saving resources. 
+ [[RGB]] - Color
+ Audio
	How could we represent audio?, audios or sound are just some waves with a specific frequency, then there we got it, what if we store a numerical value which represents that specific wave frequency, but also we could store other kind of values like the wave amplitude how noisy it sounds, the duration, and so on.
	
	So we can store a lot of things or represents them just through binary, representing them with specific binary values which we can interpret depending on the context.

Is important to spot that these arenâ€™t the only one formats or ways to represent data thereâ€™re many other. Fortunately the most of this data representations are already standardized but, not all them thatâ€™s the reason why we often find out format incompatibilities among the different OS (Operative systems) or even programs.
