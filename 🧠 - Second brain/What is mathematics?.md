We use all time the mathematics in our daily living, but what are the mathematics?, the schools almost never try to convey what are mathematics about. Instead they teach us some prior-set procedures, memorize them and apply them to solve some problems. That approach misses the "why?" and "what" of sight. 

# Mathematics history and current status
+ ## Current mathematics and its origin
	Most of the mathematics used currently in science and engineering are from the last one or two-hundred years, much of them less than a century old. But in school we still seeing mathematics which are more than three-hundred years old, or even two-thousand years.
	
	There is nothing wrong with teaching things so old if it still useful in the modernity, for example the algebra developed by the Arabic speaking traders in the eighth and ninth century still as useful as it was in that era. Although we don't use them in the exact same way.
	
	But the time moves on and the society gets the needing of new mathematics to cover all the new necessities that encounters, ensuing the raising of new mathematics, but education needs to keep pace. 
+ ## Mathematics timeline
	It is believed that mathematics started with the invention of numbers and arithmetics thousands of years ago to give the world money. 
	
	The ensuing centuries the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians expanded the subject to geometry and trigonometry, in those civilization mathematics was mostly aimed to utility, so it was almost as a set procedure, or recipe like "Do such and such to a number or geometric figure and you'll get the answer".
	
	Then in the period of the 500BCE to 300CE was the area of the greek mathematicians, which had a high regard for geometry. Indeed, they regarded the numbers a geometric fashion (Measurements of length). They also discovered that there are length which their numbers don't correspond (irrational lengths).
	
	The greeks became the mathematics into a area of study, not merely a recipe or step-by-step or techniques to solve concrete problems. Thales of Miletus introduced the idea that the assertions of mathematics could be proved logically through formal arguments. Assertion that marked the birth of the theorem, one of the fundamental bases of mathematics. That approach culminated in the publication of [[Euclid's Elements]], the second most widely circulated book of all time just after the Bible. 
	
	The development of place-value arithmetics was made in india in the first half of the first millennium, and its extensions, which include [[Algebra]], in the second half the advancements went further and in the medieval times in Europe went still further.
	
	Even tough the advances keep going further even since then, the maths taught in school are comprised of the mostly of mathematics listed above, plus just two relatively recent developments (both of the seventeenth century) [[Calculus]], and [[Probability theory]]. But, yet most of the mathematics used in today's world was developed in the last two-hundred years.

There were other civilizations which also developed math such as the Chinese and Japanese, but they're not that important in the history of the modern wester maths, so won't be mentioned

+ ## Mathematic branches
	The great explosion of mathematics lived in the last hundred years has been dramatic, the mathematics passed from around of twelve distinct subjects such as arithmetic, geometry, calculus, and others, to have today, between sixty to seventy, distinct category, some areas such as algebra or topology split into more subfields, and other areas such as complexity theory or dynamical systems theory are completely new. 
	
	This dramatical growth led to the acquisition of a new definition for mathematics, which is currently defined as the **science of patterns**, so the different branches of mathematics are science which identifies and study some patterns, like abstract patterns, numerical patterns, change patterns, motion patterns, and so on. 
	
	All these patterns can be either imaginary or real, visual or mental, static or dynamic, qualitative or quantitative, utilitarian or recreational, arise from the world or from inner workings of human mind. Different sort of patterns gave rise to different branches of maths. Such as: 
	
	+ Arithmetic and numbers theory study the patter of numbers and counting.
	+ [[Geometry]] studies the patterns of shape
	+ [[Calculus]] allows us to handle pattens of motion. 
	+ Logic studies patterns of reasoning. 
	+ [[Probability theory]] deals with patters of change.
	+ [[Topology]] studies patterns of closeness and position. 
	+ Fractal geometry studies the self-similarity found in natural worlds.
