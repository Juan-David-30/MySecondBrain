In the recent centuries the complexity and abstraction of the problems which mathematicians deals with has growth. Dealing and solving these problems, the mathematicians has encounter that many times that they're intuition is inadequate to guide their work. 

```ad-example

A example of this is the Banach-Tarski paradox

```

They've encountered that some problems can't be solve with the real-world as frame of reference, therefore they have to separate the mathematics of the real world. Hence the mathematics currently are proved and argued inside the mathematics, so we don't need a real world proof or example to regard a assertion as a fact. 


Thanks to that now the mathematics has adopted a different conception, where the primary focus isn't the calculation or performing it, but understanding and formulating abstract concepts which goes beyond of the numbers, relationships and proofs. Again, shifting **from doing to understanding**. 

#### Example

A well-know example of this change from calculating to understanding ideas an apply them beyond numbers is the *function*, before a function was defined as an algebraic expression such as: 

y = x^2 + 3x - 5.

Which given a number (x) yields a number (y). That approach or definition of a *function*, changed and now it is neither confined to a algebraic expression nor numbers, now it is any procedure or rule which receives a input and then returns or generates a output, such as follows:

If x is rational, set f(x)=0; if x is rational, set f(x)=1

Thanks to that mathematics started to study *properties* of abstract objects specified not for formulas but by its behavior.
