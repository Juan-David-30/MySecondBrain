A number is a [[Mathematical object]] used to count, measure and label. The're origin was with the **natural numbers** which had the purpose to count. Which represent a abstract quantity, 1,2,3,4, they're nothing more than a symbol which represent a abstract quantity, but a quantity of what?, it can be of anything, four eggs, four guitars, four whatever. 

And with the time we started to create or represent even more abstract meanings for those numbers, for example the negative numbers, the decimal numbers, irrational numbers, imaginary numbers, complex numbers and so on.

# Natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$

The natural numbers are the first which we learn when we're child, and also they're the first ever created, and that's because as it names indicates are natural and simplest ones to understand, they're all the whole numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, and so forth. 

# Integers $\mathbb{Z}$

This is a super set of the natural numbers, so this includes all the natural numbers plus the abstraction of the negative numbers and zero (to represent nothing).

# Rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$

This is a super set of the natural and integer numbers, but adding the idea of fractional numbers, so we split or slice numbers into many parts, so there we get concepts such as 1/2 = 0.5 = one half.

# Real numbers $\mathbb{R}$

This is a super set of all the values above but including the concept of irrational numbers, which are "incomplete" numbers in a way that they have a decimal part, but unlike the rational numbers they can't be explain in terms of fractions or divisions, rather their decimal numbers don't seem to follow a pattern, some examples of them are for example $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$, and e.

# Complex numbers
