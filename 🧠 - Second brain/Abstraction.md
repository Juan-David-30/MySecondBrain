+ ### What's  Abstraction?
	The abstraction is the simplification of a concept or process, so we don't have to worry about the low-level implementation or what is happening underneath the hood in that process.

+ ### Why is it useful?
	Thanks to the abstraction of multiple concept and process we can focus in the high level goals on process in the layer that we need, for example a car: You can drive a car and go from point A to point B without having to know how the engine or other low-level elements work. But somebody has to know it so he can deal with any problem we encounter.

```ad-note
The abstraction is a pretty common practice in [[Computer Science]], so we can encouter many abstraction of process or [[algorithms]] when we deal with computer science.
