A **programming language** is a group of constraints and defined sintaxis to express some logical ideas to a program responsable to understand them. And their existence is necessary because the computers doesn't understand the human language, of course they don't, all what computers "understand" is [[Binary]]. 
So through setting a bunch of constraints and ways to write this ideas we can easily create a program able to translate those ideas and instructions to [[Binary]], therefore they'll become something processable for the processor ([[CPU]]), this programs can work mainly of two ways, and depending on it they'll receive a name either [[Interpreters]] or [[Compilers]].

# Types of programming languages

The idea of a programming language is the same, but starting from it there is a certain flexibility so the programming languages can variate depending on its features and way to structure its constrains and way of coding. 
## By its compilation time
+ **Interpreted**: are compiled at the time of executing (This process is made by a [[Interpreters|Interpreter]])
+ **Compiled**: are compiled before start running the code (Process made by a [[Compilers|compiler]])
## By its typed 
+ **Dynamically**: Languages in which you don't have to specify the type of data that a function will return, or the type of data that a variable will save neither. 
+ **Static**: Languages in which you do have to specify the [[Data type|type of data]] that you'll save or work with in the code.

# Common functionalities 

The **programming languages** count with different functionalities which vary from one language to other, but there are some logic fundamentals which the most of the count, and these are the followings ones: 
+ [[Variables]]
+ [[Conditionals]]
+ [[Loops]]
+ [[Functions]]
+ [[Comments]]
All these are useful features are part of a basic logic of the programming languages which allows us to create multiple [[Algorithms]] and manners to deal with [[Data structures]].
Also the programming languages count with a community where the people who develop in the same language share some code, it helps to solve common problems which people faces very often or use some [[Software architectures]] easily, this with the goal of "not reinvent the wheel".  With that goal in mind we've got [[Libraries]] and [[Frameworks]].
