+ ### What's a framework?
	A framework as it names says a frame or environment to work or develop application, is a pre-set or made structure where we have the start point to start developing any sort of app. 
	The frameworks shouldn't be confused with the [[Libraries]], the frameworks give us a structure of folders and even they come with a bunch of [[Libraries]], while the libraries are a pre-made code which we can use anywhere freely wherever in our code. 

+ ### Why is it useful?
	The frameworks allows us to make apps easier, and that's because we don't have to worry about the structure of it, we already have it, and thus we can implement [[Software architectures]] easier, and we have some of the necessary [[Libraries]] already implemented as well.
