In [[Mathematical logic]] we often encounter statements such as:
$$ \phi \ implies \ \psi  $$
The statement above states that the true of $\psi$ follows from or is result of the truth of $\phi$. 

If we say that $\phi$ is the statement "The square root of two is irrational" and that $\psi$ is the statement " 0 < 1 ", is $\phi$ implies $\psi$ true?. Well the answer is not, even thought both statements are true, there isn't a relationship between them. (This in a real application of implication)

Indeed the implication involves causality, so $\phi$ has to be causal of why $\psi$ is true, otherwise it wouldn't be a implication. 

So $\phi$, the causal is known as condition (A whole implication is also known as [[Conditionals|conditional]]), whilst $\psi$ is known as causation. So implication = conditional + causation.

The implication is writing as follows:
$$\phi\implies \psi$$
Where $\phi$ or the **antecedent** is the condition and $\psi$ or **consequent** is the causal.

The **truth** of the implication $\phi\implies\psi$ is determined by the truth and falsity of $\phi$ and $\psi$. 

We threw away the causation, so we don't focus if really they have a implication or if the conditional is really what causes the truth of the causation. The correct use of the implication in in the hands of the thinkers or philosophers. And even though we don't focus in the implication, the implication behaves correctly when there exist a truly implication.

When  $\phi$ does imply $\psi$,  $\phi \implies \psi$  behaves "correctly". 

The advantage of implies is that the condition is well defined, even tough the affirmation is false and there is not a relationship between the antecedent and the consequent, when indeed, there is a relationship, the implication is well set and we know exactly which is the condition and which is the causal. 

The truth table of implication can be a little tricky.

Ok it may not make sense, but lets understand why this behavior, first we have to understand that the only way to certainly negate the truth of a implication is by saying that the negation is true: 
$$ \phi \implies \psi\ = False: \phi \not\implies \psi$$
So if $\phi$ doesn't imply $\psi$  is true, then $\phi$ implies $\phi$ is false, and the only way to affirm **certainly** that $\phi$ doesn't imply $\psi$ is that $\phi$ is true and $\psi$ is false, in absolutely any other case is not possible to affirm certainly the opposite, and as we can't leave true/false values in "mid-term" but we have to give a certain answer, we don't have other choice than saying that the implication is true. 

This truth and falsity values cover perfectly the cases of real implication, but also it covers a little more options, when it is irrelevant (when the conditional is false) and when it doesn't have a real relation between the conditional and the causal.

Is important to understand that the real importance of the implication appears when the conditional is true, so commonly we just have to worry if the causal is true and then we'll get the result of the whole implication.

# Expressions to describe implication

$\phi \implies \psi$

is read literally as $\phi$ implies $\psi$ , if we always wrote them then it would be really easy, but actually the mathematics aren't confined to just this way of write it, rather we have multiple variations to describe the same implication in the english language.

All the following examples are the same to say $\phi$ implies $\psi$ :

```ad-info
title: Remember
In all the cases $\phi$ is the antecedent and $\psi$ is the consecuent.

```


1. If $\phi$, then $\psi$ 
2. $\phi$ is sufficient for $\psi$ 
3. $\phi$ only if $\psi$ (not the same as if $\psi$ then $\phi$ )

Notice how the antecedent and consequent are flipped in the followings ones:

1. $\psi$ if $\phi$
2. $\psi$ whenever $\phi$ 
3. $\psi$ is necessary for $\phi$ 

Is important to master all this terminology, not just for mathematics but for science in general, this is the common language used in these areas, in taught, in discussion and in all the STEM topics in general.
