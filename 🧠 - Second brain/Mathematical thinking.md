	It is useful because it help us to thing further than the procedures, the **mathematical thinking** is not just memorize some step-by-step to solve a specific problem just like we used to learn in high school, rather is learn to think in a mathematical logic and how to use maths to solve different problems besides the ones that those step-by-step priorly learnt can solve.
	And even they help us to understand better those procedures, feeling more confortable using them and making them "easier".
