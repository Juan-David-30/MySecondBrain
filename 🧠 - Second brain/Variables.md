The variables are use in [[Computer Science]] and [[Mathematics]] context, but we could say that they has a similar meaning, and that's that a variable represents something, is a representation which can change or be different every time. 


# Computer science

In computer science context a variable is a direction to a space in memory (commonly in the [[RAM]]), so we can create apart a space in memory, assign a [[Data type]] or way to interprete the data stored in that space, and then refer to that space by the name assigned. 


# Mathematics

In mathematics a variable represents any [[Mathematical object]], a mathematical object can be multiple things, such as a number, a operation, a function, a matrix, vector, among others. It can be use to "abstract" these objects to center in the concept or logic, or to represent the unbeknown to try to apply multiple [[Algorithms]]/procedures to find them (that's one of the principles of the [[Algebra]]).
