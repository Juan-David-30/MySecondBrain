The fundamental theorem of algebra is relatively new compared with the algebra itself, and that's because it is based on the [[Complex numbers]], which were created or accepted a not that long time ago. 

The fundamental theorem of algebra tells us that the every polynomial equation has the same number of roots or solutions as its grade. Therefore, for a function of grade n: 
$$a^{n}+a^{n-1}+a^{n-2}+\dots+a_{0}= 0$$

a has n solutions **In the set of the [[Complex numbers]]**, often the equations can have no solutions in the real numbers, but they'll always have in the complex numbers, and that's the reason why they're so important. 

Also something important to know, is that the non-real complex solutions come always in pairs, so is impossible to have a odd number of non-real solutions, they'll always be even.
