As explained in the law of sines we can know everything about a triangle even if isn't right angle just by knowing 3 data, let's see how to know if we have one angle and two adjacent sides to that angle or when we have all the lengths but not any angle, this can't be solved through [[Law of sines]]. But don't worry as said that can be known through the law of cosines.

But what the law of cosines consists of?, the law of cosines is a similar concept to the law of sines, so we create two right-angled triangles by setting a new side which is the height. 

Now what we start to do is find the two legs to the triangle in which the opposite side of our angle is the hypotenuse and then through [[Pythagorean theorem]] we can solve its length finally having the three lengths and thanks to that we can find the other angles easier.

When we solve all this algebraically we get something as this:
$$a = \sqrt{b^{2}+c^{2}-2bc(cos\theta)}$$
If we want to find a angle having the three sides we can do as follows:

$$\theta = cos^{-1}(-\ \frac{{a{^2}-b{^2}-c{^2}}}{2bc})$$
