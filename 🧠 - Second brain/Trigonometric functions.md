The trigonometric functions are functions which relate a right-angled triangle to ratios of their sides, they're widely used in multiple science and geometry. 

# Principal trigonometric functions

## Sine (sin($\theta$))

Sine is the trigonometric function which relates the ratio of the opposite leg respect to the hypotenuse, in the [[Unit circle]] is always the parallel side to the y axis and for that reason it is widely used or related to the height, for example in physics when we're decompounding a force or movement in two dimensions to get the y axis value. 

## Cosine (cos($\theta$))

The cosine is similar to the sine, but instead of the opposite leg we deal with the adjacent leg, so in the [[Unit circle]] is the "with" because is the parallel side to the x axis.

## Tangent (Tan($\theta$))

Is the trigonometric function related to the ratio of the opposite leg respect to the adjacent side, can be also represented as the $\frac{sin(\theta)}{cos(\theta)}$, it can be also though as the "slope" of the hypotenuse because that the ratio of change in y respect to x. 

# Reciprocal functions

As said the main functions used are the ones above, but often we'll find other trigonometric functions which are somehow derivate from the primaries which are the reciprocals:

| Name      | Symbol | Reciprocal              |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| Cosecant  | csc    | $\frac{1}{\sin(\theta)}$ |
| Secant    | sec    | $\frac{1}{\cos(\theta)}$ |
| cotangent | cot    | $\frac{1}{tan(\theta)}$ |

But let's understand what actually these reciprocal functions are, and that's simple, these reciprocal functions can be thought as the same trigonometric ratios but instead of taking the hypotenuse as the length of reference equal to 1, we use either the adjacent leg or the opposite side, and then we can get all these trigonometric reciprocals by reasoning.

## Half angle identity

The half angle identities are derivate from the double angle identities, where we use those same identities but instead of $\theta$ we use $\frac{\theta}{2}$ so using the Pythagorean identity we can solve for $\cos \frac{\theta}{2}$ and for $\sin \frac{\theta}{2}$ , therefore being able to solve for the rest of them:

| $\sin \frac{\theta}{2}$         | $\cos \frac{\theta}{2}$         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| $\sqrt{\frac{1-\cos\theta}{2}}$ | $\sqrt{\frac{1+\cos\theta}{2}}$ |
