As we defined in [[Mathematical notation]], we have some ways to express the mathematical objects or concepts, and then if there is someone with the necessary knowledge to identify them, will be able to interpret them. Now, we have to be aware that what is written, even though  the concepts and objects and mathematical terms are recognized, there still may appear some misunderstood, or a same statement can have two potential interpretations.   

For that reason is important to learn the importance of the [[Precision in mathematical language]], to avoid misunderstood and the mathematicians has developed the [[Mathematical logic]] (Also known as [[Mathematical logic|Formal logic]]).
