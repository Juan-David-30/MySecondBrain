When the mathematicians started noticing that the mathematics has to be precise and then needed to simplify and or restrict the use of the language to avoid misunderstood, then the **formal/mathematical logic**.

# Simplifying the language

The mathematicians noticed that all the mathematical statements, axioms, conjectures, hypothesis and theorems could be confined or simplified in a positive or negative version of 4 different structures:

+ Object *a* has property *P*.
+ Every object of type *T* has property *P*.
+ There is an object of type *T* having property *P*.
+ If *statement A*, then *statement B*.

Of course in their works mathematicians use more fluent forms of these estructures, but they still being in essence the same, they're just variants. 

Also the greeks identified the key words or expressions involved in these statements:

+ And
+ Or 
+ Not
+ Implies
+ For all
+ There exist

Thanks to that they have a universal representation, or even a [[Mathematical notation]], so we can use them in a mathematical notation instead of using our common-human language. 

Let's see and understand more deeply the these different words: 

+ [[Logical combinators]] - and, or and not
+ [[Implication]]
+ [[Logical equivalence]] 
+ [[Quantifiers]]
