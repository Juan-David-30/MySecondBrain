Often we can find [[Trigonometric functions]] in equations, and it might make us have some trouble solving them, and more often when the variable works as angle inside of the sinusoidal equation, and that's because the [[Trigonometric functions]] are periodic, so it means that they have infinite possible values or solutions. To find them all we must make use of the [[Trigonometric identities#Periodicity|periodicity identities]]. 

# For sine

For sine we mainly have to use the identities:

The identity of periodicity for one whole revolution:
$$\forall_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}(\sin{(\theta)=\sin{\theta+2\pi n}})$$

The identity of symmetry respect y axis:
$$\sin{\theta} = \sin{(\pi-\theta)}$$
# For cosine

For cosine we mainly use the following identities:

The identity of periodicity for one whole revolution:

$$\forall_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}(\cos{(\theta)=\cos{\theta+2\pi n}})$$
The identity of symmetry respect x axis:

$$\cos{\theta} = \cos(-\theta)$$
