The complex numbers are a super of all the real numbers plus a new one, i (imaginary unit), which makes reference to the square root of -1($\sqrt{-1}$), the complex numbers are written as follows: 

$\mathbb{C}$: $\phi$ + $\psi$ i

being $\phi$ and $\psi$ real numbers, while i is the imaginary unit, the term compound of  $\psi$ and i is named the imaginary part while the term compound uniquely by $\phi$ is called the real part.
