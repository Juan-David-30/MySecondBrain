The complex numbers ($\mathbb{C}$) are a super of all the real numbers plus a new one, i ([[Imaginary unit]]), which makes reference to the square root of -1($\sqrt{-1}$), the complex numbers are written as follows: 

$\mathbb{C}$: $\phi$ + $\psi$ i

being $\phi$ and $\psi$ real numbers, while i is the imaginary unit, the term compound of  $\psi$ and i is named the imaginary part while the term compound uniquely by $\phi$ is called the real part. 

To visualize the complex numbers we have to use the complex plane. Which is a like a coordinated plane where the x axis makes reference to the real numbers value and the y axis to the imaginary part: 

![[Complex plane.png]]

Above we can visualize the complex plane, and where the complex number 3 - 5i is plot, as we can see we advance 3 units in the real axis, because of the number's real part, and we go downward 5 units because of the imaginary part, which is -5.

Again thinking this as a coordinated plane we could say that the coordinate which represent the complex numbers is ($\phi$, $\psi$).

Now we say that the complex numbers are a super set of the real numbers, and that's true, now we might be wondering how, and the answer is simple, the real numbers are just a complex number which it's imaginary part is zero, even we could describe them as that axis, the real numbers are just the real axis of the complex plane. 

So it means that for example the real number $\sqrt{2}$ is a complex number which imaginary part is zero, we could represent it this way $\sqrt{2} + 0 i$ , if we plot this number on the complex plane, we could just move through the real axis line, we wouldn't move through the imaginary axis. But the fact that we just move through that line, doesn't mean that there isn't another axis, which is the imaginary one. 

#### My interpretation

I like to think the complex numbers as a sort of numbers which doesn't just have a numerical value, but a direction, or angle, is like moving from scalar to vectors. Think the complex numbers as a value compound of values in its different axis, and the imaginary number $i$ just being the way to rotate, indeed is like rotating $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians in these perpendicular axis. And with that value, we can just represent like the component of the vector in that second axis. 

Even I feel like this complex and imaginary numbers make sense in the nature because of it, they're not a sort of different and weird value, but rather they give us the possibility to split a value in different values which compound one complete value (that's why I think them as a sort of vector). That's why they're that useful in [[Physics]], we can use them, but they're not obligatory often, we can use them to make the process easier and then take either just the imaginary or the real part. But I also think that that's natural to think in other dimensions, and the complex numbers are just that way to access to somehow measure or understand that relationship between dimensions. Indeed there is a theorem which explain the complex numbers as it, as a vector, and that theory was the used above to explain how to spot them on ht "complex plane", this theorem is the [[Vector model (complex numbers)]]. (There is also the [[Matrix model (complex numbers)]] where the complex numbers are treated as matrices).

# Understanding complex numbers

## Distance and mid point

For any reason we would like to find the real distance between two points in the real plane, and also we want to know which is the mid point between them, to do so, what we got to do is the following: 

![[Midpoint and distance of complex numbers.png]]

We got two points in the real plane, to find the distance between them, we could use the pythagorean theorem to find the "hypotenuse" or distance between the points, and to find the mid point is easy, we just have to find the mid value in each axis, so we just add the real parts and divide in two, and we do so with the imaginary parts, finding each point respectively.

## Magnitude and angle

The complex numbers often are thought as its modulus and a angle respect to the real axis, it's a common way to represent them and one very important, it takes importance in the [[Euler's formula]] and it's identity. Thus acquiring wide importance in a lot of fields: 

To understand this model of the real numbers what we have to do is again think them as a triangle, where its real and imaginary parts are the legs and the modulus the hypotenuse. now we can think in the angle formed for the modulus (r) respect to the real axis as $\psi$, to find $\psi$, what we just have to do is use our knowledge of [[trigonometry]] and the [[Trigonometric functions]] to find it. 

![[Complex numbers angles and modulus.png]]

Here we can notice how the imaginary part is r times the sine of that angle, and the real part r times the cosine of that same angle. Thus we can factorize r and we get that the real number z is equal to $r(\cos{\psi}+i\sin{\psi})$ , that can be represented as exponents of $e$ in the way of $r\cdot e^{i\psi}$, but we'll understand that better in the [[Euler's formula]], for know it's enough with knowing that relationship.

So the complex numbers can be written in multiple ways: 
+ a + bi //Rectangular form)
+ (a, b) 
+ (r, $\psi$) //Polar coordinate system
+ $r \cdot e^{i\psi}$ // Exponential way (important for the [[Euler's formula]])


$e^{i\pi}+1=0$
