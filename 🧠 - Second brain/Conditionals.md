+ ### What's a conditional?
	A conditional as it names indicates is a condition, we ask a question and depending on the answer we take decisions or we set the true of a statement, just like in the [[Mathematical logic|Formal logic]] when we set a [[Implication]]. 

+ ### Why is it useful?
	In a [[Computer Science]] context it helps us to control or modify the pipeline or [[Control flow]] by asking question with [[Boolean expressions]] and depending on the answer if either is true or false, will execute a block of code or other. 
	
	Meanwhile in a pure mathematic context it helps us to set statements or do affirmations that set the true of other through a [[Implication]].
