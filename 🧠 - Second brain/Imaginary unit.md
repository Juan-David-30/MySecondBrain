The imaginary unit is defined as the number which square is -1, and is represented with the letter "i":
$$ i^{2}= -1$$
It can also be defined as the number which is the square root of -1: 
$$ i = \sqrt{-1}$$
And it can be though as a rotation of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians from the real axis on the [[Complex numbers|complex plane]], this number is the one which allows the [[complex numbers]] to exist and help us to solve root squares of negative numbers, even helps to set the fundamental theorem of algebra.

This unit has some important properties worth to highlight and to study. 

# How to solve root squares of negative numbers

First we have to understand how is it possible to solve all the root squares of negative numbers just by including this new number, because of course all negative numbers aren't just -1. To do that we have to use the principles to simplify root squares, where we represent the number as its factors, and if we notice, all the negative numbers can be written as products of -1:
$$\sqrt{-16} = \sqrt{-1\cdot4\cdot4} = \sqrt{-1\cdot4^{2}} = \sqrt{-1}\sqrt{4^{2}}=4\sqrt{-1} = 4i$$
That's a simple example of how we can write all the negative numbers' roots as products of the imaginary unit i. 

# Powers of i

Now, one interesting and useful topic, is understand how the powers of i behave, we know that the square of i is -1, but what about the cube?, or the power of 4, or 63?, and so forth?

Well to understand it we could just go back to the properties of potentiation, where $a^{2}\cdot a^{5} = a^{2+5}$ , and we could do it vice versa. And that's useful, because if we know that i square is -1, we can find the rest of them: 
$$ i^{3}= i^{2}\cdot i^{1} = -1 \cdot i = -i$$
And that's our answer for the cube of i, is -i, now let's see the fourth power: 
$$i^{4}= i^{2}\cdot i^{2} = -1 \cdot -1 = 1$$
And so on, we can now start hunting the next powers just by knowing these first powers, for example the power of 63: 
$$i^{63} = i^{60}\cdot i^{3} = (i^{4})^{15} \cdot i^{3}=(1)^{15} \cdot i^{3}= 1 \cdot -i = -i$$
We could find this thanks to the fact that 60 is multiple of 4, so it means that can be expressed it in terms of 4, and we know the power of 4 as 1, therefore we can solve easily.
