The Pythagorean is one of the most if not the most famous theorem of all time, and indeed that's widely used and is fundamental for the [[Euclidean geometry]] and all the [[Trigonometry]], indeed many of the proofs of the theorems and laws set in trigonometry are made upon the Pythagorean theorem.

But what is the Pythagorean theorem?, well the Pythagorean theorem is a theorem which set a relationship between the two legs of a right-angled triangle and the hypotenuse. More specifically between their squares:
$$C^{2}=A^{2}+B^{2}$$
+ C : Hypotenuse length
+ A and B: legs' lengths 

But where did it came from?, we'll the Pythagorean theorem has many proofs, the most well-known are the visual ones, but I want to centre in the mathematic one which has its base on [[Similarity]].

In essence what we do is to create two similar triangles from the initial one, and then start to set equalities between the ratios of their segments, which must be equal because of their similarity. Then we add those equations obtained and we can get the famous equation $a{^2}+b{^2}=c{^2}$.
