Trigonometry mainly focus in the [[Unit circle]] and in right triangles, but there exist another sorts of triangles, which doesn't have a right angle. So how can we deal with them, how can we study about them and figure things out of them. 

Well, there is a different methods to figure things out of a triangle, indeed we can know everything about a triangle just by having 3 data, with 2 angles and 1 length or vice versa, 2 lengths and a angle. 

And a way to do that is through the law of sines. The requirement to use the law of sines is, the set of 3 data given we must have at least one pair angle/opposite side, other wise we would be able to apply what we want to, but it doesn't mean that it will stop us, in case we don't have that pair we could use the [[Law of cosines]]. 

The law of sines tells : $\frac{sin(a)}{A} = \frac{sin(b)}{B} = \frac{{sin(c)}}{C}$, tells us that the ratio of the sine of a angle over its opposite side is the same throughout the triangle.

If we set a line of height on a way that we create two right angles we can set a equality between the sines and their side because they're made on the same of height.
