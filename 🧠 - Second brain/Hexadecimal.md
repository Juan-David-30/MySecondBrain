The hexadecimal system just like the [[binary]], is just a positional system with different base, instead of having base 10 as the decimal which we commonly use, or base two as the [[Binary]], is a system with base 16, meaning that we have 16 possible values for each digit: 

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F

And also meaning that the positions are multiplied for the powers of 16 starting from zero.

It is very useful in computer science because two digits can represent the same amount of values that a whole byte does, making easier to deal with numeric values in thing as [[RGB]] and also to represent the addresses of spaces in memory.
