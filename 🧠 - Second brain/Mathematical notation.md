+ ### What's mathematical notation?
	A characteristic pretty well-known of the current mathematics is its notation, it turns out that throughout the years we've got the necessity of represent things of a abstract manner, not just for mathematics, but also for multiple function, such as we have maps for representing places or spaces on earth,  blueprints to represent the structure of a house, or sheet music to represent music, we also have a abstract notation for represent mathematics. 
	
	But is important to understand that mathematical notation is no more mathematics than musical notation is music, **just a representation**, indeed the real music is just created or start existing once a person who understand that notations interpretes what is written in the sheet music to then sing it or performance it in a instrument. 
	
	Same happens with mathematics, the notation and symbols written on a page, is not more than a **representation**, once a real competent performer read it and start to interpret it, the mathematics start to exist and get shape in our mind. 

+ ### Why is it useful?
	This degree of abstraction allows us to represent, structure, communicate, understand and create mathematics in such easier way, fo example the commutative law in English would be written as follows:
	
	*When two number are added, their order is not important.*
	
	While in a mathematical notation would be as follows: 
	
	*m+n = n+m*

### Mathematics as len to see the invisible
Mathematics as explained in [[What is mathematics?]], can represent and study some abstract patterns, and there is where the notation to represent all these abstract patterns and ideas are widely more important, and mathematics are utterly important to understand the abstract patterns of the universe.

The great book of nature can be read only by those who know the language in which it was written. And this language is mathematics.

For example [[Physics]] is described as the universe seen through the lens of mathematics. Indeed, the physics or science behind many of the phenomenas are invisible for us, isn't until we start to use the abstract mathematic ideas and representations to understand what is happening that we can "See" or imagine those forces or phenomenas happening behind.

Mathematics makes the invisible visible

Maths are useful to see the "invisible" of our world, but they're not en
