# Importance

When we work with math is pretty important to be extremely precise using the mathematical language, therefore we can avoid misunderstandings, let's take a example with the english language:

```ad-example
title: Wrong phrase
One american dies of melanoma almost every hour. 

```

What a unfortunate person... Somehow has the disgrace of resurrecting and dying almost every hour. Ok here we can see how language can be used wrong to share the intended message. Instead the message should say something like this:

```ad-example
title: Right phrase

Almost every hour, an american dies of melanoma.
```

Commonly in this sort of mistakes we can just rely that the other person will have common sense and will understand the message, in the other hand in mathematics, we can rely on it, in mathematics very often we can't follow the intuition or common sense, rather we **must** to rely in what is literal said.

For that sake we have to be aware of the literal meaning of the language which we use, and be extremely precise when we are working in mathematical concepts. 

# Solution

A sort of solution to avoid all these problems and misunderstood, the mathematical language limits the use of the language in a highly strict way, all this restriction and study behind how to do mathematical statements, procedures and so on is known as [[Mathematical logic]].
