+ # What's a function?
	[[Computer science]] is a subset of [[mathematics]], so as explained in [[Mathematics moving off from reality and numbers]], a functions is:
	![[Mathematics moving off from reality and numbers#Example]]
	That's the definition of function, now in a more computational context the rule or internal computational working can be a [[Algorithms|Algorithm]], and the input received for the function is called argument while the out put can be also a side-effect.

+ # Why is it useful?
	A function can be useful for multiple reasons, for example they allow us to set a relationship between values to generate a result or computation, for example get the position of a element respect the time with a certain velocity and acceleration ([[Physics]] [[Straight movement]]). 
	
	Or in a [[computer science]] context it allows us to create a computation process or [[Algorithms|Algorithm]] and [[Abstraction|Abstract]] it, therefore we can use it multiple times giving it different **arguments** which can alter its behavior, side-effects or return value.
