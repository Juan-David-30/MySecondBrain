A equations system is a system in which two or more equations are related between them, so we can solve problems in which there are several variables, indeed this is one of the fundamentals of the [[Linear algebra]]. But it can be used in the algebra in general.

When we're facing this sort of systems we have multiple options to face:

1. When we have the same information (number of equations) and the same number of variables: in this case we face what we call a compatible system determinate, where we can find a determined or specific solution to our variables.
2. When we have more variables than information: in this case we have a compatible undetermined, where we can have more than one solution to each variables, even infinite solutions. 
3. When we have more information than variables we have an incompatible system where we can just not have a exact solution.

There are several techniques to solve this sort of problems or systems, here there are some examples:

1. Substitution: we clear the variable in one of the expressions and in other one we substitute the cleared variable by the expression obtained, then we clear the other variable and we have the solution for that variable (Now we can substitute that value in any expression and then solve the other one).
2. Equalization: we isolate both equations the same unknown factor and then we equal both expressions, then we have to clear just the factor/variable needed. 
3. Elimination: we just have to operate the equations trying to "eliminate" or delete a variable, then solving easily the other one as normal.
