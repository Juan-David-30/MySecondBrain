The unit circle is a circle of ratio 1, which is often used in [[Trigonometry]] to study the [[Trigonometric identities]]:

Because we know that the circle has a ratio of one, it means that if we draw a ray starting from the centre, no matter the angle, the length of the segment form the centre to the interception with the circle's border will be always one (as the ratio).

So if we use axis as reference we can measure the the length of the interception respect of each axis, and then get the ratio between the two legs while the hypotenuse stays constant (is the segment of the ray from the centre to the interception with the circle's border which is always one). So the distance from each of the both axis is the ration of the hypotenuse and each leg.

On the unit circle we construct the [[Trigonometric functions]] for the [[Trigonometric identities]].
