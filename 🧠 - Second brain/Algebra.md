Algebra is the area of mathematics devoted to study expressions with variables which represent [[mathematical objects]], the most of the time [[Numbers]]. 

Commonly when we deal with this expressions we use the concepts of equality or any other relationship between them and then try to find the possible values of a specific variable. 
$$2x + 4 = 8$$
This is a example of a algebraic expression, in this case an equation, in which we're setting that what's on the left is the same as what's in the right. So we might wonder what's the specific value of x, what's the number which multiplied by two and added four, we get 8.

Of course that's what algebra deals with, commonly we'll find more complex expression such as:

$$ \frac{8x^4+x^3}{2}+4x^2-16x-8= 0$$
 In this case we can see that the variable is twice, this is a function of grate 4, because the greatest exponent of a variable in this case is 4, the one before was of grade 1, which is also known as linear equation, these equations are the simplest to solve, they also can have multiple variables and can be groups with multiple expressions([[Equations systems]]), all these topics are studied by [[Linear algebra]]. 

Know let's see the following example of a equation of grade two:

$$x^2-4 = 0$$
In this case we can notice that the value of x can be either 2 or -2, so, is it possible that a equation has two solutions?. 

Yeah, a equation can have two, three, four, and even more solutions, but we don't have to worry too much about it. Indeed the number of solutions depends directly on the grade of the equation, so the linear equations have one, the quadratic equations two, cubic three, and so on. This solution often can be not possible to find in the [[Numbers#Real numbers $ mathbb{R}$|real numbers]] but in the complex numbers. 

The assertion specified above is known as the fundamental theorem of algebra.
