Indeed mathematics is the science which identify and study any pattern. 

# Pure mathematics

Mathematics is a broad science, therefore has a bunch of different branches which study different patterns and applications of them, sometimes, the mathematics branches not necessarily need to look for a application. So here are the branches which are part of the mathematics purely, they don't need strictly a application to real world (They can have it though).
