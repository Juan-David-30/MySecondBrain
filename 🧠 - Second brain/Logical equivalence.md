The logical equivalence express that two statements are equivalent if they two imply each other, so the logical equivalence has a really close relation with the [[Implication]].

The equivalence plays a central rol in mathematics, indeed they are for logic, what equality is for arithmetics. 

As in [[Implication]] we had to create a analogy to avoid the complexity of causation, in equivalence we had to do the same by setting the biconditional. Two statements $\phi$ and $\psi$ are said to be logically equivalent if each implies the other. 

Biconditional $\phi$ $\iff$ $\psi$ is a abbreviation of ($\phi\implies\psi$) $\wedge$ ($\psi\implies\phi$). 

So $\phi$ $\iff$ $\psi$ is true if either they both are true or they both are false. 

One way to show two statements are **equivalent** is to show they have the same truth tables (commonly we won't do this, is really inusual). 

As we have terminology for the implication: ![[Implication#Expressions to describe implication]]
We also have terminology for equivalence, and that terminology derives specially from the [[Implication]] terminology. 

"$\phi$ is equivalent to $\psi$ " is itself equivalent to: 

1. $\phi$ is necessary and sufficient for $\psi$
2. $\phi$ if and only if $\psi$ (abbreviated as "iff")

```ad-info
Notice how all this terminology is a combination of the terminology used above for implication, **mixing** a expression where the antecedent is on the left and the consecuent in on the right, and one where they're are flipped, to express the logic of a **biconditional**.
