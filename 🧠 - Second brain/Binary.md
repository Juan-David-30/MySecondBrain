+ ### What's binary?
	**Binary** is a numerical system which allows us to represent information, it has only two possible values per digit either 0 or 1, and it a base-2 system, so the value of the position of each digit is equal to 2 to the position value.Â 

+ ### Why is it useful?
	Binary is really useful in computer science, because it allows us to represent data in terms of bits (binary digits) which are either 0 or 1, the possibility of having just two values allows us to represent them of many manners, in case of computers with electricity current (1) or not electricity current (0).
