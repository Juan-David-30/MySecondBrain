+ ### What's a comment?
	When we are [[Programming]] a comment is a part of code which won't be executed, in the moment that the [[Compilers|compiler]] or the [[Interpreters|interpreter]] read the commented lines in the document, they'll just ignore them.

+ ### Why is it useful?
	The comments are pretty useful, may be not for the logic of the [[Algorithms]] itself, but for the better understanding and organization of the code, with them we can create [[Pseudocode]] that's a sort of sketch of the logic will create later on code, or just for explain the code that we've written and it's purpose, so later on when we're reviewing it or somebody else is doing it, it'll be easier to understand.
