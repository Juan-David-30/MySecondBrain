We've already worked with the [[Trigonometric functions]] where getting a angle as input it gives us a ratio as output, the sine the ratio of the opposite leg and the hypotenuse, the cosine the adjacent leg and the hypotenuse and the tangent the opposite leg over the adjacent one. 

Right but what if we want the opposite case, instead of getting the angle and then obtaining the ratio, what if we have the ratio and we want to know to which angle it corresponds. 

Ok there exist functions which do this inverse process, and they're the arc functions, which are the [[Inverse functions]] of the [[Trigonometric functions]], they are the followings:

| Sine       | Cosine     | Tangent    |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| arcsin     | arccos     | arctan     |
| sin$^{-1}$ | cos$^{-1}$ | tan$^{-1}$ | 

So for example we know that sin$\frac{\pi}{4}$ =$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, and sin$^{-1}$($\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$) =$\frac{\pi}{4}$

But we have a problem, and that that as we saw in the trigonometric identities the trigonometric functions have [[Trigonometric identities#Periodicity|periodicity]] what make them repeat periodically the outputs, so we have the problem planted in the [[Inverse functions]], and that's that one same input can have multiple outputs, and if that happens then we don't have a function.

So to solve that we had to limit the domain of the original functions, so we can map to exclusively one value. 

So $\theta$ is limited with the following range: $-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}$ for the arcsine and arctangent (but in tangent the extremes aren't inclusive) functions, while for arccosine is $\pi \ge \theta \ge 0$ .
