A data type is as it name indicates a type of data which we assign either to a [[Variables|variable]], return value of a [[Functions|function]], even the arguments which that function receive, and so on. There exist a lot of different data types, they're useful to tell the computer how to interpret that specific data type, because to a same pattern of bytes we can interpret them of different ways, so with the data types, we tell the computer of which way do it. 

# Primitives

Commonly the [[programming languages]] have a bunch of basic data types, and the rest of the data types are constructed upon them, these basic data types are called primitives, like the following ones: 
```ad-info
These examples are astracted from the programming language [[C]]

```
+ int : Integer number (32 bits, 4 bytes)
	+ unsigned int: integer number but with just positive values, so we can have greater values
+ float : floating-point (32 bits of precision, 4 bytes)
+ long: integer number (64 bits, 8 bytes)
+ void : void (empty, more a type than a data type)
+ char: character (8 bits, 1 byte)
+ double : double (float but with 64 bits of precision)

# Major level data types

And upon the primitives there are others such as: 

+ Bool type: true or false
+ Void Data Type: empty Value
+ Enumerated data type: Enums
+ Derived Data type: Union, structure, array, etc.
