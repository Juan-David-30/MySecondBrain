Scratch is a "[[Programming languages|Programming language]]" and environment able to run it, designed for the MIT primary to learn to code, it provides a visual and friendly environment where all the features of a programming language such as the [[loops]], [[conditionals]], and [[Functions]] are blocks which you just grab, drag and connect, making a lot easier and nicer to interact and learn all these concepts. 

+ # Scratch environment
	
	Scratch makes the use of different functions and [[Control flow]] features actually easy, it is a graph environment such as this:
	
	![[Scratch environment.png]]
	
	In the left side we see all the blocks, which are all the functions and features that we can use while creating programs with scratch, they're intuitive sort by functionalities like motion, looks, sound, [[events]], among others. 
	
	In the middle we have a huge white space which is our "code area", where we have to drag all the blocks of the left section to create our program.
	
	In the right-bottom we can see the spreads area where all the characters and objects are shown, while in the right-top area we can see the state of those spreads. 
	
	We don't have to deal to often with mathematics in scratch, but we have to mention that in the state area, how or more precisely where the characters are shown depend of coordinates, where the center is defined as the (0,0) coordinate:

# Blocks
As said in the environment we have bunches of blocks filtered by functionality let's see some of them: 

+ [[Events]] The events are the yellow blocks section.
+ [[Functions]] 
	+ Aren't set in a specific color or section, rather they're multiple, the functions are the actions that the program do, in scratch are from saying something to moving the character, passing for changing the appearance and so on.
	+ We can create our own functions and [[Abstraction|Abstract]] our own algorithms and also download other extensions to extend the functionality of scratch. 
+ [[Control flow]]
	The control flow are the orange blocks which comprise of [[Conditionals]] and [[Loops]], or even we can indicate to the program to wait. 
+ Sensing we could say that are a sort of interactive [[Boolean expressions]].
+ [[Operators]] here there mathematical and boolean operators.
