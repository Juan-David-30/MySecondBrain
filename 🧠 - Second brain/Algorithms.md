A **algorithm** is a process or set of rules or instructions with a sequence (a sort of step-by-step), which once are followed can solve a specific problem, do a specific action or perform a [[computation]]. 

The algorithms aren't limited to code or a [[programming languages]], rather they're ideas and procedures which can be represented in multiple languages, but also can be represented even in human language, often they're represented in [[Pseudocode]], to then be applied to a real programming language, or even  they're just concrete algorithms to solve concrete computational problems such as the [[Euclid's algorithm]].


# Example of algorithm written in pseudo code

This is the famous text book search of a a name of Harvard taught in the [[CS50X]].

## Identifying elements
We can see how this algorithm comprises of many individual structures which has a different behavior:
+ ### [[Functions]]
	The function in this case are all the verbs or action, such as pick up, open, look, and so on. 
+ ### [[Conditionals]]
	Are all the if and else if in the algorithm, and the question asked in the conditional are the [[Boolean expressions]].
+ ### [[Loops]]
	In this case are the "Go back to line 3"
